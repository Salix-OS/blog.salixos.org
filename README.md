This repository hosts the files for the Salix blog hosted at
[blog.salixos.org](https://blog.salixos.org).

The website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The `master` branch
includes the generated html files that actually show up in the website,
while the `source` branch includes the Markdown source files that Hugo
parses.
