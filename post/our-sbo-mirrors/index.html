      <p>We have been mirroring the
<a href="http://slackbuilds.org/">slackbuilds.org</a> (SBo) repository and at the
same time applying slight changes to it for some time now. These
changes are essential to Salix, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, the SBo maintainers have decided that they will only list
SlackBuild dependencies only if these are not part of a Slackware full
installation. While this may be a decision that is fine for Slackware
itself, since they don&rsquo;t offer any kind of support for users doing
anything other than a full Slackware installation, it&rsquo;s generally not
good for Salix, since a Salix installation of any edition, is slimmer
than a full Slackware installation, by far. For example, in Slackware
it is expected that everyone has the Qt libraries installed, but this
is definitely not true for Salix (except from our KDE edition of
course). So, a lot of the SlackBuilds at SBo end up having
missing dependencies when it comes to a Salix installation.</p>

<p>Then, there is a problem with package/SlackBuild naming. We have a lot
of packages in the Salix package repositories that are also present in
the SBo repository. While we try to keep the package naming consistent
with the one they&rsquo;re using in SBo, that is not always possible. For
example, at this moment, there is a package named &ldquo;python-configobj&rdquo; in
our package repositories and another one named &ldquo;configobj&rdquo; in SBo,
which are actually the exact same piece of software. Even if we made
every effort and named everything at the time of release according to
the SBo names, SBo is constantly changing and SlackBuilds may be
renamed.</p>

<p>Another problem (for lack of a better word) is that SlackBuild
maintainers choose to update their SlackBuilds as soon as a new version
of the software they are packaging is out. While this might not be bad
in itself, it kind of conflicts with the way things work for the binary
package repositories in Slackware and also in Salix, which generally
follow the idea that upgrades should only be done for security reasons.
And since there is a very wide overlap between packages offered in the
Salix binary package repositories and the SlackBuilds provided by SBo,
there are often newer versions available in SBo than in the Salix
binary package repositories. This might confuse users, because by
opening Gslapt, they find one version and by opening Sourcery, they
find another, often newer, version. What&rsquo;s more, if they were to
&ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to the version available in SBo, they would find that
Gslapt/slapt-get would want to &ldquo;downgrade&rdquo; that package to the version
available in the Salix binary repositories and the only way to stop
that would be to put the package in the EXCLUDE list in their
slapt-getrc file.</p>

<p>So, in Salix, we have to deal with these problems. Here&rsquo;s what we do&hellip;</p>

<p>Our own copy of the SBo repository, the one that is available by
default to Salix users through our package management tools is synced
with the main SBo repository every few hours.</p>

<p>For the first problem mentioned above, we have a mechanism for adding
&ldquo;missing&rdquo; dependencies in our copy of the SBo repository. For example,
the ardour SlackBuild requires cmake to build. Now, cmake is always
thought to be present in a Slackware installation, otherwise it is not
a full Slackware installation and it is not supported in any way. In
Salix though, cmake is definitely not part of a standard installation
and so we add it as an extra dependency for ardour.</p>

<p>For the second problem, we have created a list of packages/SlackBuilds
that are named in a different way between repositories. Every
SlackBuild that is also present as a binary package in the Salix
repositories with a different name, is removed from our own copy of the
SBo repository and every reference to it in dependencies is replaced
with the name that the package has in our own binary package
repository. This way, the package in the Salix binary package
repositories is always used, even if it is originally named otherwise
in the original SBo repository.</p>

<p>Finally, all software that is present in both the Salix binary package
repositories and SBo, is removed from our own copy of the SBo
repository, so there is no way users will be confused and go back and
forth between versions. Actually, the SlackBuilds themselves are not
removed from the repositories, rather the reference for them in the
SLACKBUILDS.TXT file is removed, so it isn&rsquo;t used by our SlackBuild
management tools, slapt-src, Sourcery or spi.</p>

<p>With SBo being a moving target though, this process will always be
ongoing and will never be 100% complete. If you find a SlackBuild that
is missing some dependency, please report it, either in our
<a href="http://salixos.org/mailinglists.html">mailing list</a>
or in our
<a href="http://forum.salixos.org/">forums</a>.
Similarly, if you find the same SlackBuild
present in both the Salix binary package repositories (hence available
in Gslapt) and our own copy of SBo repositories (hence
available in Sourcery), please report that too. Of course
feel free to report any other problem you might find with our
repositories.</p>
