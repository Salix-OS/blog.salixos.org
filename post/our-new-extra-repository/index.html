      <p>You might have noticed that just before the Salix Xfce 14.2RC1 release
a new repository, named extra-14.2 has appeared in our servers. This
has been enabled by default in the 14.2RC1 and 14.2RC2 releases and
will be also available in the final 14.2 release.</p>
<p>This new repository is present for both i486 and x86_64 architectures
and its purpose it to include packages built from SlackBuilds found at
<a href="https://slackbuilds.org/">slackbuilds.org</a>.
At this moment, it&rsquo;s not that full, only about 20
packages are included in it. These are mostly there as proof of concept
and for initial testing. Eventually, the extra repository will be
filled with packages for almost every SlackBuild present in SBo.</p>
<p>For the purpose of automatically building the packages, a new tool,
<a href="https://github.com/gapan/sbobuild">sbobuild</a>,
has been developed. This takes a list of SlackBuild names as
input and continues to build the respective packages, create complete
source code trees and keep a log of every build. It&rsquo;s not perfect
(yet), it was written in a hurry, but it does the job it is supposed to
do for now. Other similar tools exist, like
<a href="https://github.com/idlemoor/slackrepo">slackrepo</a>, but they are only
meant to be used in Slackware. As such, they don&rsquo;t take into account the
many packages that are already included in the Salix repositories and
may introduce conflicts. What sbobuild does, is check if any given
software available in SBo is already availabe in the Salix repositories
and if it is, it just skips it. For building and uploading the packages
that are created to our main repository, we now have a new server, which
was only made possible due to user donations.</p>
<p>Currently, the <code>libraries</code> directory of SBo is being processed and
packages keep coming out. As soon as this batch is finished, they will
all be uploaded to the main repository and the next batch will follow.
The <code>libraries</code> directory alone consists of more than 800 packages and SBo
holds more than 5000 SlackBuilds. Considering that most SlackBuilds do
not take advantage of multiple processors/cores to spawn multiple build
instances, this task is going to take some time.</p>
<p>Now, SBo has a few known shortcomings. There are some SlackBuilds that
are just unmaintained and have not been updated for a long time, in some
cases for years. Then, there are others that have broken download links
for their respective source tarballs, sometimes intermittently. And then
there are cases of conflicts and incompatibilities that sometimes are
known, but in other cases are not and nobody has noticed. Finally, there
are a few SlackBuilds that are about software that is really meant to
only be built from source. One such examples is ATLAS, which needs to be
tuned for every single CPU it runs on. Due to this nature of SBo, not
every SlackBuild is guaranteed to work and that is the reason why not
everything will be finally built. Of course we&rsquo;re keeping logs with
<em>everything</em> that fails and we will try to fix some of those builds that
failed for any reason.</p>
<p>Additionally, SBo has a policy of constantly updating its contents with
new versions, which in my opinion is competely against Slackware&rsquo;s
policy (as well as our own) for stability. For that reason, our extra
repository will remain mostly static. That means that we will not update
packages with newer versions just for the sake of having a newer
version. However if we receive reports that something is terribly broken
or severely compromised, we will definitely try to fix it. Newer
versions, as they are updated in SBo, will be available through
Sourcery/slapt-src for any users that want them, but users then will
have to take care of any conflicts that might arise.</p>
<p>Also, the packages in the extra repository have not been thoroughly
tested, certainly not in the level that packages in the standard Salix
repositories have. Think of it as an equivalent to the <em>Universe</em>
repository in Ubuntu, if you&rsquo;re familiar with it.</p>
<p>In some cases, mostly with Python and Perl libraries and software, not
all dependencies will be listed. If you find such a case, please notify
us (in the forums or the mailing list) and we&rsquo;ll try to fix it.</p>
<p>Since the extra repository has a lower priority in the <code>slapt-getrc</code>
settings than the standard Salix repositories, Salix specific packages
will always override their counterparts in the extra repository and the
users will have no problem updating their systems just by using
<code>slapt-get</code> from the command line or gslapt from the GUI.</p>
<p>I think this is very exciting news for Salix. The new 14.2 release is
going to include more software than was ever available in the
repositories for previous releases.</p>
