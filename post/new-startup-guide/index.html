      <p>We&rsquo;ve been working on this for a while and were hoping to have it ready
by the time 14.1 is released and it seems that we managed to make it!
You can now find the new guide
<a href="http://salixos.org/guide.html">linked from our main website</a>.</p>

<p>The startup guide was left with no updates since the 13.37 release, so
it was getting a bit old. It was still mostly OK, but there were things
that were out of date.</p>

<p>Another thing that was getting in the way was the format that the guide
was written in. A tool called Publican was used to create the previous
guide, but newer versions of it seemed to only work in Debian (or was
it Fedora?). Anyway, it wouldn&rsquo;t work on Salix/Slackware
anymore, so we had to switch and convert everything to the new format.
Once again, the solution was to go with
<a href="http://txt2tags.org/">txt2tags</a>.</p>

<p>So, we converted everything to the txt2tags format. From the txt2tags
format, we can acquire the equivalent in html output very easily. Then,
in turn, the html output is processed through
<a href="https://www.msweet.org/projects.php?Z1">htmldoc</a>
to split it in
multiple pages and create a table of contents and a lot of sed magic is
used to apply css formatting to the output so it looks nice.</p>

<p>The upside of using txt2tags is that it&rsquo;s not only html output that it
can produce. Using the same source file, tex files can be created.
These can be processed throught TexLive to create a pdf file. And since
this is LaTeX we&rsquo;re talking about the result looks absolutely
professional. Still, some sed magic was needed here too, in order to
make fine changes, but after initial setup, pdf generation is
completely automated.</p>

<p>Producing ebooks is the next step. Creating epub and mobi files from
the html output is almost ready and these will also be available for
download soon. So, you could read the Salix Startup Guide in your
favourite ebook reader.</p>

<p>The only downside of using txt2tags like that, is that currently there
is no provision for translations. There is simply no way to do it in a
sane way. Truth is that translators put a lot of work in the previous
versions of the guide, but it seems that we won&rsquo;t be able to provide
localized versions of the guide anymore.</p>

<p>The guide may not be 100% ready yet, there might still be small issues
that need taking care of, but we think that it&rsquo;s ready for public
release as it is. If you find anything that you may think needs fixing,
please contact us through our
<a href="http://salixos.org/mailinglists.html">mailing list</a>.</p>
