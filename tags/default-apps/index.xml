      <description>Even during the development phase of Salix 15.0, more than a year ago, I was getting questions and comments about which the default (GUI) text editor would be. I still get those questions in my inbox. So, Salix 15.0 came with Xfce 4.16. And Xfce&amp;rsquo;s default text editor is Mousepad, but we elected not to include it in the default app selection for our release. Instead, we included L3afpad, which is essentially a GTK3 port of Leafpad, the default editor in all our previous releases, including at least Salix 14.</description>

      <description>A Display Manager is the application that provides a graphic user interface (GUI) that is displayed at the end of the boot process and lets the user authenticate themselves by providing their username and password, before entering their preferred X11 session, for example Xfce, KDE, fluxbox, etc.
Up until Salix 14.2, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using a very old version of GDM as the default display manager. Actually we&amp;rsquo;ve been using the same major version of GDM, which is 2.</description>
