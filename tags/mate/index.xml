      <description>MATE 1.8 has been released in source code form by its developers about 3 weeks ago and I have been working on packages for Salix for about as long. The good news is that I think I&amp;rsquo;m almost done! So, expect MATE 1.8 packages to hit the repos sometime in the following days. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any MATE release for Salix 14.0, but it looks like we are going to have one for 14.</description>
