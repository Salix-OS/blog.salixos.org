      <description>Short answer: No.
Somewhat longer answer: Not yet, but we&amp;rsquo;re getting there. There&amp;rsquo;s still lot&amp;rsquo;s of things to do, but there will be an alpha release soon (hopefully).
Really long answer:
It has been almost two weeks now that Slackare 15.0 has been released (yay!) and there are now regular inquiries on IRC and in the forums concerning the release of Salix 15.0.
So, no, Salix 15.0 is not ready yet.</description>

      <description>It seems like, finally, the pieces are being put in place for the next Slackware release. It has been a long wait, it will be 5 years since the 14.2 release in a few months. Since Salix releases are tied to Slackware releases, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a Salix release for a long while too. Major changes that the next Slackware release will introduce include a switch to PAM, Linux kernel 5.</description>
