      <description>Neofetch is a command line tool that shows some information about the running system. It is not very detailed information and it is not a very useful tool, but it is fancy.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote of its description from its homepage:
The overall purpose of Neofetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system. Neofetch shows the information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Choosing the default text editor</title>

      <description>Even during the development phase of Salix 15.0, more than a year ago, I was getting questions and comments about which the default (GUI) text editor would be. I still get those questions in my inbox. So, Salix 15.0 came with Xfce 4.16. And Xfce&amp;rsquo;s default text editor is Mousepad, but we elected not to include it in the default app selection for our release. Instead, we included L3afpad, which is essentially a GTK3 port of Leafpad, the default editor in all our previous releases, including at least Salix 14.</description>

      <title>On Display Managers</title>

      <description>A Display Manager is the application that provides a graphic user interface (GUI) that is displayed at the end of the boot process and lets the user authenticate themselves by providing their username and password, before entering their preferred X11 session, for example Xfce, KDE, fluxbox, etc.
Up until Salix 14.2, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using a very old version of GDM as the default display manager. Actually we&amp;rsquo;ve been using the same major version of GDM, which is 2.</description>

      <title>Our new extra repository</title>

      <description>You might have noticed that just before the Salix Xfce 14.2RC1 release a new repository, named extra-14.2 has appeared in our servers. This has been enabled by default in the 14.2RC1 and 14.2RC2 releases and will be also available in the final 14.2 release.
This new repository is present for both i486 and x86_64 architectures and its purpose it to include packages built from SlackBuilds found at slackbuilds.org. At this moment, it&amp;rsquo;s not that full, only about 20 packages are included in it.</description>

      <title>Our SBo mirrors</title>

      <description>We have been mirroring the slackbuilds.org (SBo) repository and at the same time applying slight changes to it for some time now. These changes are essential to Salix, for a few reasons.
First of all, the SBo maintainers have decided that they will only list SlackBuild dependencies only if these are not part of a Slackware full installation. While this may be a decision that is fine for Slackware itself, since they don&amp;rsquo;t offer any kind of support for users doing anything other than a full Slackware installation, it&amp;rsquo;s generally not good for Salix, since a Salix installation of any edition, is slimmer than a full Slackware installation, by far.</description>

      <title>How much of Slackware is in Salix</title>
      <link>https://blog.salixos.org/post/how-much-of-slackware-is-in-salix/</link>

      <description>That is a question that I had in my mind for a while. At some point I had also done the actual counting, so I had an idea, but I never wrote anything down.
There are many people that believe that a derivative distribution only just leeches their parent distribution, maybe changing the default wallpaper or a couple of settings here and there and making a release. I know for a fact that some people that have never tried Salix (or have tried Salix but never Slackware itself) even think the same for Salix.</description>
