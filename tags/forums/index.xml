      <description>Unfortunately, we&amp;rsquo;re having a huge problem with spammers in our forums. Most of the users that register are actually spammers. This has been going on for a while too.
About a year ago (or maybe more than that? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure), we moved to using Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;I am not a robot&amp;rdquo; checkbox reCAPTCHA. This, is supposed to be the best countermeasure against bots. Before doing that, spammers were also a big problem.</description>
