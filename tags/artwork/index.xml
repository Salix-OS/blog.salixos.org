      <description>Neofetch is a command line tool that shows some information about the running system. It is not very detailed information and it is not a very useful tool, but it is fancy.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote of its description from its homepage:
The overall purpose of Neofetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system. Neofetch shows the information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.</description>
