      <description>We now have our own capsule on Gemini!
But what is Gemini and what is a capsule? Gemini is a lightweight, text-based protocol for sharing content on the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be simple and efficient. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to the http(s) protocol, but with many restrictions that limit its functionality. These restrictions were included in the Gemini protocol on purpose, so there&amp;rsquo;s no chance that the Geminispace (the collection of all Gemini pages) will ever become the mess that the modern web is.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, we&amp;rsquo;re having a huge problem with spammers in our forums. Most of the users that register are actually spammers. This has been going on for a while too.
About a year ago (or maybe more than that? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure), we moved to using Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;I am not a robot&amp;rdquo; checkbox reCAPTCHA. This is supposed to be the best countermeasure against bots. Before doing that, spammers were also a big problem.</description>

      <title>New Website Design</title>

      <description>As many might have noticed, we now have a new main website design!
Since the Salix project was started, the main website was actually a part of our wiki, which is using the MediaWiki engine. That had one main advantage, which at that time seemed enough to justify that choice; we would use a single CMS to manage both our wiki and our main page. So, we created a custom MediaWiki theme that would look good as a main project page and as a wiki.</description>
